          <!---Predictive Modeling 

          Using a RandomForestClassifier, we developed a predictive model to identify customers most likely to respond positively to the marketing campaign. 

          Accuracy: 0.892 

          AUC (Area Under Curve): 0.647 

          RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 0.329 

          These metrics indicate that the model performs reasonably well in predicting customer responses, with high accuracy and acceptable error rates. The model can be used to target customers more effectively in future campaigns, potentially increasing the acceptance rate and profitability.
